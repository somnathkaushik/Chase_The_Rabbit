# Chase_The_Rabbit
It is a multiplayer game. For rabbit use (w,s,a,d) and for turtle use(Arrow Up , Arrow Down , Arrow Left , Arrow Right)
Place rabbit 🐇 and turtle 🐢 in there respective boxex. 
Now player 1 will save the rabbit and Player 2 will catche it. 
you can tap a button a time as ( tap tap tap tap.......) , don't hold the button.
I have used basic js just fore movement of both the objects.
